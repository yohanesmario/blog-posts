As what I've experienced first hand, newlyweds are prone to unnecessary fights caused by lack of mutual understanding on how to manage their marriage. It's not only about who should do the dishes, but also how it should be done. A difference of how one stack the plates on the sink can be a trigger for a fight. No matter how much you think you've discussed, there's always gonna be things that slips your mind and ended up triggering a fight.

The title might have been too obvious, basically we're trying to do scrum for our marriage. Marriage should be a product which needs constant improvements. Doesn't matter if you're just married, or you're 50 years in it, there will always be room for improvements. So, how should we do this?
